            <p>It was always hard for me to use some thing(only in a programming world =) ) without understanding how actually this thing works. Someone can say that it's actually a problem and it's hard to develop complex things without such skill. But based on my experience exceptions are present everywhere. And everybody has it. What should we be able to do is take our &quot;disadvantages&quot; and turn them into advantages. I won't show you many examples of it, just left the most appropriate person to this context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What I cannot create, I do not understand&quot; - Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in MYOX series I'll demonstrate fundamentals behind things which I wanted to understand.</p>
<p>All things I'll implement with Rust programming language since I think that Rust is a next big thing in programming languages world as well as in software products and we need to expand its areas as wide as we can.</p>
