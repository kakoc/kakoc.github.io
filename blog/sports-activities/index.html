<p>I've tried a lot of different sports activities and want to share my experience with them.<br />
Also my goal is to highlight those which are more appropriate for the programmer.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection<a class="zola-anchor" href="#reflection" aria-label="Anchor link for: reflection">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>There are different kinds of sports and they have different requirements from you: </p>
<ul>
<li>concentration</li>
<li>explosion </li>
<li>release a lot of energy for a short period of time</li>
<li>monotonous work with low energy consumption</li>
<li>equipment</li>
<li>commute</li>
<li>recovery</li>
<li>variety</li>
</ul>
<p>All these bullets influence the choice.</p>
<p>Based on my experience when you have a lot of brainwork it's hard to do explosion work, work when you need to release a lot of energy for a short period of time, work when you need to keep the high concentration level.<br />
The basic idea is that all those factors don't allow you to relax. Instead they unwind the psyche and as the result I come from such trainings more tired + I need more time for recovery.<br />
Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>gym</li>
<li>martial arts(boxing gym, wrestling, mma)</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of being &quot;aggresive&quot; lets consider other:</p>
<ul>
<li>swimming</li>
<li>running</li>
<li>cycling</li>
</ul>
<p>At such work you can do useful job and at the same time think about life, admire the surroundings(not with swimming =)). Also it's a good opportunity for travelling. There are a lot of marathons, cycling competitins over the world. Additionally I found that it improves your psyche, because for the first time it's really hard to run 20km for example. And not because of high physical load, but because it's a long period of time. You need some time to learn how to look forward and abstract from the outside world, otherwise you can &quot;eat&quot; yourself from the inside by your thoughts. So yes this is some sort of meditation skill which you will develop with time.<br />
A small tip: try to train without music because it doesn't allow you to relax, most of the time you listen music and its give you a mental power for work on the training, so you don't control the training, you do training just because of music. You should find a way of control such things on your own, just with your mind, without any factors from the outside.</p>
<p>So I run a couple of times in the week and started to look for the same activities. I found swimming, cycling and even the dedicated kind of sport - triathlon. I begun to swim, spin cycle and it gave me even more satisfaction. Because after that my sports activities are very varied. With such schedule really hard to be busy mentally.<br />
Drawbacks: </p>
<ul>
<li>for cycling need a cycle + bike station -&gt; $$$</li>
<li>for swimming need to go to a dedicated place and spend much time before and after a swimming pool</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="zola-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>For programmers from my point of view suitable sports activities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>swimming</li>
<li>running</li>
<li>cycling</li>
<li>football</li>
<li>volleyball</li>
<li>basketball</li>
<li>tennis</li>
<li>yoga</li>
<li>gym(only light)</li>
<li>rock climbing</li>
</ul>
<p>But not: </p>
<ul>
<li>powerlifting, </li>
<li>weightlifting</li>
<li>martial arts</li>
<li>boxing</li>
<li>wrestling</li>
<li>mma</li>
</ul>
